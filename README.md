# JS Frameworks

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frontendjess/repoimagesportfolio/main/images/jsframeworks-mockup.png)

One of my school projects, for JavaScript Frameworks course assignment. The focus for this project was entirly code based and no styling. :)

Live website: https://jessica-nextjs-nextauth.netlify.app/

## Description

My app has the following paths which was one of the requirements:

- "/"
- "/detail/:param"
- "/contact"
- "/admin"
- "/api/auth/signin"
- "/api/auth/signout"

Objectives:

- Hard-coded json with an array of items is in /libs/employeesJson.js
- Index page with one item displaying at least 2 properties from result
- Detail page displays one item with at least 3 properties
- Contact form validation with Formik
- Login auth with NextAuth using Github provider - (signin & signout)
- Client side authentication - (useSession)
- Secured client side page is admin page

I decided to fake API call using local data instead of a live API endpoint.

## Built With

I built my project in Next.js, hard-coded JSON, used Formik and NextAuth for login. Deployed live website on Netlify.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Formik](https://formik.org/)
- [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
